# Salience Trees (Alpha Trees)
This repository contains the code for the bachelor project on alpha trees. To run the main algorithm navigate into the `alpha-tree` directory and execute the following commands:
```
make
./saliencetree <input image> <lambda>  [omegafactor] [output image]
```

This will create an output .ppm image created with the specified parameters. A few example .ppm images can be found in the `Images` directory.

## Authors
The following students of the University of Groningen have contributed to this repository. The initial code basis of the alpha tree algorithm has been provided by the project supervisor Micheal Wilkinson.</br></br>
